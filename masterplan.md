## User Interface Design Principles

### Dashboard Layout

#### Student Dashboard
- Header with logo, user profile dropdown (settings, logout)
- Main content area with:
  - Greeting and student information
  - Grid of course cards with hover effects
  - Each card displays course name, section, and a relevant image
- Sidebar with navigation to:
  - Dashboard (home)
  - Calendar
  - Profile

#### Course Content View (Student)
- Breadcrumb navigation (Dashboard > Course Name)
- Course header with course information
- Tabbed navigation (if needed for different content types)
- Content organized by modules/chapters in expandable sections
- Content items with download/view options

#### Teacher Dashboard
- Similar to student dashboard but with teaching courses
- Additional action buttons for content management

#### Content Management (Teacher)
- Module/chapter management interface
- Content upload forms with preview options
- Announcement creation interface
- Calendar event management

### Design Elements

#### Color Scheme
- Primary: Orange (#FF7A00)
- Secondary: Black (#000000)
- Accent: Light Orange (#FFB366)
- Text: Dark Gray (#333333) on light backgrounds
- Background: Light Gray (#F5F5F5) with white content areas

#### Interactive Elements
- Card hover effects: Slight scale increase, shadow depth increase
- Page transitions: Fade or slide transitions between views
- Loading animations: Spinner or progress bar with the orange theme
- Toast notifications: Slide-in notifications for action confirmations

## Security Considerations

- JWT authentication with proper token expiration and refresh mechanisms
- Password hashing with strong algorithms
- Role-based access control for all API endpoints
- Content access restrictions based on enrollment
- Input validation on all forms
- CSRF protection
- Secure file upload handling
- Prepared statements for database queries (via SQLAlchemy)

## Development Phases and Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation and Authentication (2 weeks)
- Set up project structure (Flask + Vue)
- Create database models and migrations
- Implement user authentication with JWT
- Create basic user management

### Phase 2: Core Functionality - Student View (2 weeks)
- Implement student dashboard
- Create course content viewing interface
- Build calendar view

### Phase 3: Teacher Functionality (2 weeks)
- Implement teacher dashboard
- Create content management interface
- Build announcement system

### Phase 4: Admin Functionality (1 week)
- Implement API endpoints for course/class management
- Create user assignment endpoints

### Phase 5: UI Enhancement (2 weeks)
- Implement animations and transitions
- Refine styling and responsiveness
- Add interactive elements

### Phase 6: Testing and Refinement (1 week)
- Create mock data for testing
- Test all functionality
- Fix bugs and improve performance

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: File Storage Management
**Solution**: Start with local filesystem storage with proper organization, but design the architecture to easily swap in cloud storage like AWS S3 later.

### Challenge: Creating an Interactive UI without Overcomplicating
**Solution**: Use Vue's built-in transition components for simpler animations, and gradually add more complex animations with GSAP or similar libraries as needed.

### Challenge: Ensuring Proper Access Control
**Solution**: Implement middleware for both frontend and backend to verify permissions based on user roles, and create a comprehensive test suite for access control.

### Challenge: Data Organization for Courses and Modules
**Solution**: Use order_index fields in the database to allow for easy reordering of content while maintaining a consistent display order.
